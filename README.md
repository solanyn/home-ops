## <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f4a1/512.gif" alt="💡" width="20" height="20"> Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I practise using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps using tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

---

## <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f331/512.gif" alt="🌱" width="20" height="20"> Kubernetes

My Kubernetes cluster is deployed with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev). This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server with ZFS for NFS/SMB shares, bulk file storage and backups.

There is a template at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Internal Kubernetes container networking interface.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to certain ingresses.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to a DNS provider.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops): Managed secrets for Kubernetes and Terraform which are commited to Git.
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel): Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
📁 kubernetes
├── 📁 apps           # applications
├── 📁 components     # commonly reused components e.g., status monitoring templates + volsync backed pvc
└── 📁 flux           # flux system configuration
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys my applications with dependencies. In most cases a `HelmRelease` will depend on other `HelmRelease`'s, in other cases a `Kustomization` will depend on other `Kustomization`'s, and in rare situations an app can depend on a `HelmRelease` and a `Kustomization`. The example below shows that `atuin` won't be deployed or upgrade until the `rook-ceph-cluster` Helm release is installed or in a healthy state.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A>Kustomization: rook-ceph] -->|Creates| B[HelmRelease: rook-ceph]
    A>Kustomization: rook-ceph] -->|Creates| C[HelmRelease: rook-ceph-cluster]
    C>HelmRelease: rook-ceph-cluster] -->|Depends on| B>HelmRelease: rook-ceph]
    D>Kustomization: atuin] -->|Creates| E(HelmRelease: atuin)
    E>HelmRelease: atuin] -->|Depends on| C>HelmRelease: rook-ceph-cluster]
```

While I self-host infrastructure and workloads where I can, I rely on cloud services for key parts of my setup.

In my cluster there are two instances of [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) running. One for syncing private DNS records to my `Unifi UXG Ultra` using [ExternalDNS webhook provider for UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook), while another instance syncs public DNS to `Cloudflare`. This setup is managed by creating ingresses with two specific classes: `internal` for private DNS and `external` for public DNS. The `external-dns` instances then syncs the DNS records to their respective platforms accordingly for split-horizon DNS.
